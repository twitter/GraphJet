Recos, or Real-time Content Suggestions, is a heterogeneous graph
based system that produces personalized content suggestions for users
in real-time. The content recommendation mechanism based on the
heterogeneous graph has two desirable properties: (a) it is
contextual, i.e. recommendations are based on a user’s current context
(tweets she’s tweeting/retweeting/faving/reading/clicking, and her
network), and (b) it will be an exploration mechanism that will refine
itself with each user interaction in real time.

The architecture for making these content recommendations is (at a
high-level) as follows: we listen to real-time user interactions and
build a heterogeneous graph of user to content, which then allows
running real-time algorithms on this graph. Thus, given a user at
query time, we run a collaborative filtering algorithm to provide
content recommendations of the kind: “People who did A also did B”,
given that the input user did A.
