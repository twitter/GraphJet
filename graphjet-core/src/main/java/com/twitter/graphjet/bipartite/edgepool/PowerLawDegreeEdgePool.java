/**
 * This edge pool is for the case where the nodes degrees approximately follow a power law with the
 * restriction that the node degrees are upper bounded by the power law, i.e. if the power law
 * assumes that there are x nodes with degree d, then the graph will have at most x nodes with
 * degree d.
 *
 * Conceptually, the implementation works by spreading the edges of nodes across a number of pools.
 * Each of these pool services nodes at a particular level in the power law distribution, i.e. pool
 * 0 contains all nodes, and pool i only has nodes who have degree greater than 2^{i + 1}. Note that
 * our assumption of the power law (as stated above) implies that we have an exact upper bound on
 * the number of nodes in pool i. Within each pool, we allocate the same fixed amount of space for
 * each node. Since each pool allocates a fixed number of edges per node, it is implemented via the
 * {@link RegularDegreeEdgePool}. Note that the overall setup ensures that all pools are the same
 * size, with the degree per node increasing as the pool number increases while the number of nodes
 * in the pool decreases.
 *
 * NOTE: The implementation here-in assumes that the int id's being inserted are "packed" nicely. In
 * particular, suppose there are n nodes to be inserted. Then the actual int id's for these n nodes
 * _must_ always be no larger than c*n for some constant c. The memory usage here is proportional to
 * c*n, so it is best to make c as small as possible.
 *
 * Assuming that there are n nodes, we can allocate memory in the pools via a power-law scheme.
 * Here is a sample calculation assuming an exponent of 2:
 * - There will be k pools, numbered 1 through k
 * - Max edges per node stored in pool i = 2^i
 * - Max number of nodes in pool i = n / 2^{i-1} (power-law assumption)
 * - Total number of edges stored, m = 2n + 2^2 * n/2 + 2^3 * n/2^2 + ... + 2^k * n / 2^(k-1) = 2kn
 * - Max degree of a node = 2^{k+1} - 1 = 2^{m/2n + 1} - 1 (example: max degree = 2047, if m = 20n)
 *
 * Assuming n nodes and maximum degree in the pool is d, the amount of memory used by this pool is:
 * - O(4*2*lg(d)*n) bytes for edges (which is expected to dominate)
 * - O(4*lg(d)*n) bytes for nodes
 * - Note that if d = O(n), which is expected for power law graphs, the amount of memory used here
 *   is O(n*lg(n)) as opposed to O(n^2) which is what would happen if we allocate a regular-degree
 *   pool instead.
 *
 * Note that the power-law assumption is NOT binding, i.e. if the degree distribution violates the
 * power law (or has a different exponent), the graph operations will still work with the same
 * complexity. The only harmful effect is that the amount of memory needed would be more than the
 * calculation states above.
 *
 * This class is thread-safe even though it does not do any locking: it achieves this by leveraging
 * the assumptions stated below and using a "memory barrier" between writes and reads to sync
 * updates.
 *
 * Here are the client assumptions needed to enable lock-free read/writes:
 * 1. There is a SINGLE writer thread -- this is extremely important as we don't lock during writes.
 * 2. Readers are OK reading stale data, i.e. if even if a reader thread arrives after the writer
 * thread started doing a write, the update is NOT guaranteed to be available to it.
 *
 * This class enables lock-free read/writes by guaranteeing the following:
 * 1. The writes that are done are always "safe", i.e. in no time during the writing do they leave
 *    things in a state such that a reader would either encounter an exception or do wrong
 *    computation.
 * 2. After a write is done, it is explicitly "published" such that a reader that arrives after
 *    the published write it would see updated data.
 *
 * The way this works is as follows: suppose we have some linked objects X, Y and Z that need to be
 * maintained in a consistent state. First, our setup ensures that the reader is _only_ allowed to
 * access these in a linear manner as follows: read X -> read Y -> read Z. Then, we ensure that the
 * writer behavior is to write (safe, atomic) updates to each of these in the exact opposite order:
 * write Z --flush--> write Y --flush--> write X.
 *
 * Note that the flushing ensures that if a reader sees Y then it _must_ also see the updated Z,
 * and if sees X then it _must_ also see the updated Y and Z. Further, each update itself is safe.
 * For instance, a reader can safely access an updated Z even if X and Y are not updated since the
 * updated information will only be accessible through the updated X and Y (the converse though is
 * NOT true). Together, this ensures that the reader accesses to the objects are always consistent
 * with each other and safe to access by the reader.
